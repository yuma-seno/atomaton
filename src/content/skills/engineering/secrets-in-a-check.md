# When a check needs a real credential

The question is usually one line: does this endpoint accept our token, is this
scope enough, can this script read the thing it is meant to read. Every version of
it has the same shape — **the answer exists only at the far end of a credential**,
and this run does not have one.

## Why you cannot do it here

Three walls, and the first two are what you will hit:

- **The shell holds no repository secret.** Every tool server receives only the
  credentials its own configuration declares; `github` and `atomaton` hold a token
  and `shell` does not. So `curl`, `gh` and `printenv` have nothing to send, and
  `curl` and `gh` are refused outright for the routing reason
  (`engineering/environment` covers what to do about a refusal).
- **A pull request may not decide its own execution environment, and nothing that
  runs for one holds a secret.** That is not a rule you can work around: the step
  that runs a pull request's declared commands has *nowhere to write a credential*,
  which is a property of the workflow rather than today's configuration.
- **`web__fetch` is text only.** It can POST a form-encoded body and nothing else —
  no binary payload and no `Authorization` header.

Do not look for a way past these. Asking for a tool that would make the check
possible earlier is asking for **a credential in the hands of code nobody has read
yet**, which is the thing all three exist to prevent.

## What to do instead

**Write the tool, and let the tool's own call be the check.** Almost every check
like this is the first use of something that has to exist anyway — a server that
publishes a file, a client that reaches a new endpoint. Build it, and make it able
to **report what the far end said** rather than only succeeding or failing.

That is why `defaults.yaml`'s entries carry `env:`, and why a server that holds a
token is the right shape for this: **the credential stays in the server and never
reaches a shell.** The check then runs where the tool runs, after a person has
merged it.

**Verify the shape here, and the far end there.** Before the merge you can check
the request, the parameters and how the response is read, against a stub. Say in
the pull request what a person should run once it is merged, and what answer would
mean the design is wrong.

## Ask before a secret is spent

A call against a real endpoint is not free and not always reversible — it can
create something, spend a quota, or leave a record.

- **Say what you want to send, to where, and what it would create.** "One 2KB
  `.txt` to `uploads.github.com/user-attachments/assets` for `yuma-seno/atomaton`"
  is the level to aim for.
- **Prefer a request that cannot store anything.** Many endpoints tell you
  everything you need from a deliberately incomplete one: a missing required
  parameter comes back as a validation error rather than a `404`, which proves the
  route exists, and the status for a rejected credential is distinct from both.
  A check that writes nothing needs no permission and leaves no cleanup.
- **If something IS created, say how it is removed** before you create it, and do
  it in the same run.
- **A person's yes is for one call**, not a standing licence to use the credential
  whenever it helps. If a second call is needed, ask again and say what changed.

## What not to conclude

A refusal is not evidence that your check is unnecessary. It is evidence that the
check belongs somewhere else — and the reason it belongs there is worth writing
down, because the next reader will wonder the same thing:

- Put the decision about **where** the check runs in the issue or the pull request,
  not only in your report. "This cannot run here because the shell holds no
  credential" is a fact the next run should not have to rediscover one refusal at
  a time.
- If the check showed that a premise in the issue is wrong, say so. A design built
  on "we can verify this first" is a design that changes when it turns out nobody
  can.
